# TO-DO LIST

This repository contain a **task manager** made with **ExpressJS** and Mongoose.

To watch the project you have to _clone it_, install **npm** modules and **Bower**.

This project responds to `localhost:3000/tasks`

## Available Actions

### [**POST**] `tasks`

Add a task just giving a title value.

```bash
    curl -X POST --data "title=Do the harlem shake" localhost:3000/tasks
```

### [**DELETE**] `task/:id`

To remove elements from the task manager, you just need the id of the element.

```bash
    curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/task/592b10534828231a386a6aa5
```

### [**PUT**] `task/:id`

To edit an element you just need the id. You can change the task from _pending_ to _done_ || change the title.

```bash
curl -X PUT --data "completed=true" localhost:3000/task/592b10534828231a386a6aa5
curl -X PUT --data "title=Do the Best harlem shake" localhost:3000/task/592b10534828231a386a6aa5
```

## Updates / Notes

- I updated several Node dependencies in `package.json`. Run `npm install` before starting.
- MongoDB is required: the server now waits for a DB connection and will exit if Mongo is not reachable. Start Mongo locally or with Docker before `npm start`.

  Quick Docker command:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name mongo-dev -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0
  ```

  Or start the system service (if installed):
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start mongod
  ```

- Do not run `npm run dev` and `npm start` at the same time â€” both use port 3000 and will conflict (EADDRINUSE). If you need a different port, set `PORT` environment variable.
- The project still contains `bower.json` and `client/bower_components`. Bower is deprecated; consider migrating frontend deps to npm/yarn.
